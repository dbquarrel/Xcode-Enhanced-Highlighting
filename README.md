Xcode-Enhanced-Highlighting
===========================

xclangspec files and color schemes for Xcode3 and Xcode5 that allow you to target the method names in definitions and declarations for special highlighting. For Xcode5 also supports special colors for blocks (class methods, instance methods, and closure blocks can have different colors). Some work is needed as it is not compatible with context highlighting (i.e. project identifiers).
